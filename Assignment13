Assignment 13

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
Ans.SELECT customer_id, city, rating, 'High Rating' FROM customer WHERE rating >= 300 UNION (SELECT customer_id, city, rating, 'Low Rating' FROM customer WHERE rating < 300)


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
order.
Ans.SELECT customer_id,  cust_name FROM customer a WHERE 1< (SELECT COUNT (*) FROM orders b WHERE a.customer_id = b.customer_id) UNION (SELECT salesman_id, name FROM salesman a WHERE 1 < (SELECT COUNT (*) FROM orders b WHERE  a.salesman_id = b.salesman_id)) ORDER BY 2

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
besides the point.)
