Assignment 17

1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
excluded from the date field.
Ans.ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD PRIMARY KEY(ONUM);
    ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD CONSTRAINT Unique_CNUM_SNUM  UNIQUE(CNUM,SNUM);
    ALTER TABLE ORDERS MODIFY SNUM INT NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE ORDERS MODIFY CNUM INT NOT NULL;

2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
Ans.CREATE TABLE SALESP ( COMM INT(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 10, SNUM INT(4) PRIMARY KEY, SNAME VARCHAR(20) CHECK(SUBSTR(UPPER(SNAME),1,1) BETWEEN A AND M));

3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
Ans.CREATE TABLE ORD ( ONUM INT(4)  CHECK((ONUM>CNUM) AND NOT NULL), CNUM INT(4) CHECK((CNUM>SNUM) AND  NOT NULL), SNUM INT(4) NOT NULL);
